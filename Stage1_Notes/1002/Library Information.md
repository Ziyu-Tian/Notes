# 1: Library and essential skills
## 1.1: The importance of information literacy
* It is the ability to think and make balanced judgments about the information we find and use, which is a academic skill.
* where, which sources, how you base your work on solid evidence, how to be responsible.
* Being critical.
## 1.2: Information types
* Academic information:
    * Peer-reviewed journal articles
    * Published conference
    * Textbooks 
    * Thematic monograph
    * Edited collections
    * Research reports
* Professional and technical:
    * Magazine
    * Professional guideline
    * Policy papers
    * Reports
    * Statistic and specifications
    * Standard
    * Case study
    * News items
    * Material property data
    * Equations
## 1.3: Evaluating information
* What, How reliable, Who wrote, When, Why
## 1.4: Searching information using Library Search
* Use 'libsearch.ncl.ac.uk' to search
* Use the keyword connected with 'AND' to search the information.
* Use the quotation mark " " to treat something as a phrase.
* Use the search option beside the searching box to choose "everything" or "everything except articles".
* Use the filter on the left side to choose the filter choice like: full-text online and peer-reviewed.
* Use the **citation** which can copy the book as references and choose the reference criterion.
## 1.4: Searching information using Knovel search
* Use 'Knovel' to find engineering data such as materials properties and related equations.
* The Knovel can also be used as a equation solver.
# 2: Reference and Plagiarism
## 2.1: When do you need to reference and when not
* You need to include a reference whenever you use information from someone else's work. It doesn’t matter where that information came from - web sites, textbooks, journal articles, magazines, newspapers, computer programs, images, social media - if you use it, reference it.
* When something is considered as common sense, you don't need to quote is as a reference.
## 2.2: Reference Styles
* **Harvard at Newcastle** is the most commonly used referencing style at Newcastle University and in Engineering is used alongside **IEEE**. 
* A successful reference is made up of two parts:
    * an indication in the text where someone else's work has been used.
    * a reference list or bibliography which lists the full details for the reference.
### 2.2.1: Harvard
#### 2.2.1.1: Reference a book
*  Surname, Initials.(Year of Publication) *Title of Book in Italics*. Place of publication: publisher. 
* Harvard at Newcastle style tells us to list only the first author and include *et al*.
#### 2.2.1.2: Reference a journal article
* Surname, Initials. (Year of Publication) ‘Title of article in single quotes’, *Title of Journal in Italics*, Volume (Part/month/season where applicable), page numbers:
* DOI can be added to the end, but it is not essential
#### 2.2.1.3: Conference paper
* Surname, Initials. (Year of Publication) ‘Title of paper in single quotes’, *Title of Conference in italics*, Location and date of conference, Page references for the paper (if available). 
* DOI can also be added.
#### 2.2.1.4: Websites
* Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (2020) *Onshore wind: part of the UK's energy mix*. Available at: https://www.gov.uk/guidance/onshore-wind-part-of-the-uks-energy-mix (Accessed: 17 July 2020).
#### 2.2.1.5: Tweet
* Surname, Initial. (Year tweet posted) [Twitter] Day/month of tweet posted. Available at: URL (Accessed: date).
### 2.2.2: IEEE
#### 2.2.2.1: Reference the book
* [1] B. Stoevesandt, G. Schepers, P. Fuglsang, and S. Yuping Eds, *Handbook of Wind Energy Aerodynamics*. Cham: Springer, 2019.
* Note that IEEE includes all the authors unless there are six or more.
* The title of the whole publication - book title, journal title, website - is always shown in italics and the year of publication is at the end of the reference. 
#### 2.2.2.2: Reference a journal article
* Initial. Surname, "Title of article," *Title of journal*, volume, issue number, pages, Abbreviated month day, year of publication. doi:.
#### 2.2.2.3: Reference a conference paper
* Initial. Surname, "Title of paper," *Name of conference*, City of conference, US state or Country, Year, Pages. doi:.
#### 2.2.2.4: Websites
* [7] Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy "Onshore wind: part of the UK's energy mix," *Gov.uk*, https://www.gov.uk/guidance/onshore-wind-part-of-the-uks-energy-mix (accessed July 17, 2020).
## 2.3: Plagiarism
* While **some words have been changed** this is also an example of plagiarism even though the source has been acknowledged in the reference list. **Without an in text citation**, it would not be possible for the reader to distinguish between your work from the source you have copied. 
* Copying and pasting text does not demonstrate to your lecturers that you have read and synthesised the information. **Always aim to express what you have read in your own words**.
