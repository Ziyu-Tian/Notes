# II: Friction and Impulse
## 1: Introduction of friction
* A force that tends to oppose motion.
## 2: Law of Dry friction
### 2.1: Maximum friction force (limiting friction)
* $F_F=\mu R$, $R$ is the normal press force.
* $\mu$ is the **coefficient of static friction**.

* Summary:  
    * When it is static: $F_F=F$ and max$F_F=\mu R$
    * When it is moving: $F_F=\mu _sR$
    * $\mu _s$ is coefficient of sliding friction
    * Normally $\mu > \mu_s$
# 3: Momentum and Impulse
## 3.1: Introduction
* Aimed to process the changing force.
## 3.2: Linear momentum
* $p=mv$, it is a vector quantity.
* A new definition of force, force= rate of change of momentum.
$F_x=\displaystyle\frac{dp_x}{dt}$.
* Worked for a rigid body (no rotation).
## 3.3: Linear impulse
* $\displaystyle\int _{t_1}^{t_2}{Fdt}=\Delta p=p_2-p_1$
* Note that $p_2-p_1$ is a vector operation.
