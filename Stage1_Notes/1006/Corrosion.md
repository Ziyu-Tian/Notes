# VIV Corrosion
## 1. Corrosion Origin
### 1.1 Nature of Corrosion
* Corrosion is a spontaneous process that turns metals in alloy back to their natural state.
* The surface or the film could be protective to the corrosion.
### 1.2 The reason cause the corrosion
* The thermodynamics second law: entropy$\uparrow$
### 1.3 The cost of the corrosion
* Corrosion costs will climb
* Need to work in more hostile environments.
* Life Cycle Costing
   * Investment in quality materials provides long-term savings on operations/maintenance.
## 2. The classification of the corrosion
* Dry oxidation
* Emulsions
* Aerosols and Mist
* Aqueous corrosion
   * Corrosion is an electrochemical process
   * It involves:
     * Removal of electrons(oxidation) in anode
     * Consumption of electrons(reduction) in cathode
* Necessary components of a corrosion cell:
   * Must have a anode and cathode
   * Must have metallic path connection
   * The double nodes must be immersed in a conductive electrolyte
## 3. Conservation of Energy
* The same rate at the double node.
* The anode becomes more acidic.
* The cathode becomes more alkaline.
* $eg:$
$$
Anode:2Fe-4e^-=2Fe^{2+} 
$$
$$
Cathode:O_2+2H_2O+4e^-=4OH^-
$$
## 4.Reaction at the nodes surface
### 4.1 Anode reaction
* Metal = Metal Cation + electrons
Cation + water = Metal Oxide + $H_3O^+$
### 4.2 Cathode reactions
* water + oxygen + electrons= Hydroxyl Anions
* water + electrons= Hydrogen + Hydroxyl Anions
## 5. Forms of Corrosion
### 5.1 Uniform attack
* Oxidation and reduction occur randomly across the surface
* can be predicted and eased
### 5.2 Localised corrosion
#### 5.2.1 Introduction
* occurs when distinct anodic and cathodic regions formed
* difficult to spot
#### 5.2.2 Galvanic attack and how to limit
* occurs between two metals having different composition and connected to a electrolyte
* How to limit:
   * Choose 2 metals are close together in galvanic series.
   * Insulate the different metals.
   * Large the size to nodes.
* $eg:$
   * Galvanised Steel,Zinc as a coating to be sacrificial anode and oxide choke.ï¼ˆCathodic Protection using Sacrificial Anodes)
#### 5.2.3 Pitting Corrosion
* Localised
* Leading to perforation failures
* Related to passive surfaces with defects or microstructural variations
* Oxygen Differential
   * Driven by oxygen
   * Cathodes in high oxygen areas
   * Anodes in low oxygen areas
* Coating Effects
   * The damaged paintwork blister is due to the oxygen differential.
## 6. Flow and Corrosion
### 6.1 Erosion-corrosion(by wind)
* Combined action of chemical and mechanical attack as a consequence of fluid motion
* Harmful to passivate metals
* Increasing fluid velocity increase corrosion rate
* solutions more erosive when bubbles and suspended particulate solids present
### 6.2 Cavitation
* Mechanical dominated the corrosion
* Due to bubbles collapsing on solid
* How to decrease:
   * Choose cavitation resistant alloy
   * using a more hydrodynamic propeller design
## 7. Faraday's Law
* Corrosion rate obeys,
$$
Q=zFm
$$
* Q=I.t=Coulombs; 
* z=number of $e^-$in this reactions
* F=Faraday's constant(96500C/mol); 
* m=number of moles of material reacted
* All aqueous corrosion obey the law including localised corrosion
