# VIII Fracture and Fatigue
## 1. Fracture
### 1.1 Ductile and Brittle Transition
Depend on temperature materials can show different mechanical properties.
* Brittle fracture at lower T.
* Ductile failure at higher T.
* $eg:$The liberty Ships suffered brittle transition fractures on North Atlantic.
## 2. Fatigue
### 2.1 Reasons
* Failure by cyclic loading at stresses below tensile stress and usually below yield stress.
* Caused by the nucleation and growth of a crack.
* Below critical size, crack initiation is relatively slow while failure occurs when crack reached the critical size.
* $eg:$Fatigue cracks initiated from high stressed window corners being cyclic loaded.
### 2.2 Fatigue Testing
#### 2.2.1 Fatigue Test
* The cyclic applied loading is compressive /tensile or only tensile.
* It contains
   * Cyclic uni-axial loading
   * Wohler rotational bending
   * Bend Test
   * Beam Loading
#### 2.2.2 Rotating shafts and Fatigue Tests
* Rotating bend test
   Stress range s=$\sigma_r$
* Appearance of fatigue failures
   * Macro:beach marks
   * Micro: striations
   * Little necking
   * Crack run from free surface where stress concentration exist.
#### 2.2.3 Variable Amplitude Loading :Miner's Law
* Consider a component at stress for cycles $n_1,n_2...n_n$, if the life stress on each level is $N_1,N_2,N_N$, Then the Miners rule states that:
$$
\sum_{j=1}^{j=n}\displaystyle\frac{n_j}{N_j}=1
$$
* Fatigue is accumulation of damage or ductility
* Loading is fully reversed with no mean stress or strain
* Change the loading level does not alter proportion of life remaining.ï¼ˆonly depend on the material )
  $eg:$
  If we use a third of the component life up at one stress level , it will be same as other level.(same as strain)
### 2.3 Corrosion Fatigue
* Do not have a corrosion fatigue as a common fatigue
* Can occur in aqueous,gas and liquid metal systems.
