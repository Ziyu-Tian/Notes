# XI: Composites
## 1:Introduction
### 1.1 What is composites
* A multiple phase material that possesses properties of constituent phases.
* Components require low densities,strong,stiff,abrasion,impact and corrosion resistant.
* Natural composites
    * Wood
    * Bone
### 1.2 Composites materials
* Often consist of two phases;
    * Matrix phase: continuous phase
    * Dispersed phase:
      * -
      * -
      * -
    * Factors that need to be considered :
      * a:Concentration
      * b:Size
      * c:Shape
      * d:Distribution
      * e:Orientation
## 2:Particle and Fibre-Reinforced Composites
### 2.1 Particle-reinforced composites
* The matrix distributes some of the applied stress to the particles.
* The degree of the reinforcement depends on strong bonding at the matrix-particle interface.
* For small particles, the dispersed particles can impede the dislocation motions and thus the plastic deformation is restricted and improved yield, strength and hardness.
* For example: concrete use ceramics for both matrix and dispersed particles.
### 2.2 Rule of mixture
* It is used to predicted the upper and lower bound od modulus of elasticity.
* For a two-phase composites:
    * The upper bound:$E_{c,u}=E_mV_m+E_pV_p$
    * The lower bound :
    $$
    E_{c,l}=\displaystyle\frac{E_mE_p}{V_mE_p+V_pE_m}
    $$
    * E and V denotes the modulus of  elasticity and volume fraction.
    * c,m and p represent composites,matrix and particulate phases
### 2.3 Fibre-reinforced composites
* It is designed to produce a materials with high strength and/or stiffness on a weight basis.
* This depends on the fibre length,orientation and concentration.
* The properties are highly anisotropic.(Different properties in different directions).
* -
* -
* -
* -
* Stage I, elastic deformation for both fibre and matrix.
* Matrix will yield and undergo plastic deformation at $\varepsilon_{ym}$ while the fibre continues to be elastic.(Stage II).
* In Stage II, it is nearly linear, but the slope is less steep than Stage I.
* In Stage II, the proportion of the applied load borne by the fibres increases.
* The composites begins to fail when the strain reaches $\varepsilon _f^*$.
* But the failure is not catastrophic due to:
    * Variation of fibre strength.
    * The matrix is still intact as $\varepsilon _m^*>\varepsilon _f^*$
    * The fractured fibres is still embedded in the matrix ad can still sustain load as the matrix continues to deform plastically.
## 3:Elastic behaviour - longitudinal adn transverse loading
### 3.1 Longitudinal loading
* $F_c=F_m+F_f$
* $\sigma_cA_c=\sigma_mA_m+\sigma_fA_f$
* $\sigma_c=\sigma_m\displaystyle\frac{A_m}{A_c}+\sigma_f\displaystyle\frac{A_f}{A_c}$
* F,$\sigma$ and A are load, stress, cross-section area.
* c,m and f are composites, matrix and fibres.
* If the composites, matrix and fibre phase lengths ae equal, $\displaystyle\frac{A_m}{A_c}$ is equal to volume fraction of the matrix($V_f$), $\sigma_c=\sigma_mV_m+\sigma_fV_f$
* With excellent bonding between the interface, deformation of both matrix adn fibres are the same Isolation state:$\varepsilon_c=\varepsilon_m=\varepsilon_f$.
* $\displaystyle\frac{\sigma_c}{\varepsilon_c}=\displaystyle\frac{\sigma_m}{\varepsilon_m}V_m+\displaystyle\frac{\sigma_f}{\varepsilon_f}V_f$
* $E_{cl}=E_mV_m+E_fV_f$
* $V_m+V_f=1$, so $E_{cl}=E_m(1-V_f)+E_fV_f$
* $\displaystyle\frac{F_f}{F_m}=\displaystyle\frac{E_fV_f}{E_mV_m}$
### 3.2 Transverse Loading
* Isostress State:
$$
\sigma_c=\sigma_m=\sigma_f=\sigma
$$
$$
\varepsilon_c=\varepsilon _mV_m+\varepsilon_fV_f
$$
$$
\displaystyle\frac{\sigma}{E_c}=\displaystyle\frac{\sigma}{E_m}V_m+\displaystyle\frac{\sigma}{E_f}V_f
$$
$$
\displaystyle\frac{1}{E_c}+\displaystyle\frac{V_m}{E_m}+\displaystyle\frac{V_f}{E_f}
$$
$$
E_{ct}=\displaystyle\frac{E_mE_f}{V_mE_f+V_fE_m}=\displaystyle\frac{E_mE_f}{(1-V_f)E_f+V_fE_m}
$$
### 3.3 Tensile Strength
* Max longitudinal tensile strength of a composites, $\sigma_{cl}^*$, $\sigma_{cl}^*=\sigma _m^{'}(1-V_f)+\sigma _f^*V_f$
* $\sigma^{'}_m$ : stress in the matrix at fibre failure
* $\sigma_f^*$ : fibre max strength
