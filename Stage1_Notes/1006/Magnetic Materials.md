# XII:Magnetic Materials
## 1:Atomic magnets:Electron Spin
* Atoms are made up from :
    * Electrons
    * Protons
    * Neutrons
* They all have mass and spin.
* Spin is a quantum property:
    * up(1/2) and down(-1/2), the magnets directions
    * Spins tend to pair:1/2 & -1/2,but the unpaired electron produced the magnetism.
    * Effective spin, $S$, is the sum.
## 2: Beyond a single atom - magnetic ordering
* All atoms with order numbers of electrons must have unpaired spins(even can too).
* The unpaired spins in neighboring atoms interact and the type of interaction caused the magnetic order.
* In some transition metals spins line up to form simple permanent magnets.
## 3:Beyond a single atom-Ferromagnetic ordering
* Each of the atoms can be thought as a  bar magnet.
* The combination of these magnets which all pointing in the same way is called Ferromagnetic ordering.

## 4:Magnetic domains
* Atoms in solid are spaced by ~$\text{\AA}$
* Over $\mu$ m's, magnetic materials in domains.
* Domains are randomly orientated.
* An external magnetic field line them up.
* When turn off, we have a permanent magnet.
* Real domains:Cobolt(Co)

## 5:Magnetic hysteresis
* At "0":
    * Domains are randomly aligned.
    * No net magnetic flux from the materials.
* 0-b:
    * Domains aligned gradually
* b-c:
    * All domains aligned
    * Further increase in flux is linear and reversible
    * No further magnetization
    * Saturation
    * -
    * -
    * -
* Reduction the external fields:
    * Some domains remain aligned.
    * d is termed remnant flux.(we made a permanent magnet).
    * -
    * -
    * -
* We can continuously cycle the external field, switching the direction of alignment of the domain periodically.
* Switch the domains cost the energy.
* The energy is proportional to the area of the hysteresis loop.
* This energy heats the metal.
* This contributes to inductive heating to anneal steel.
## 6: Hard and soft ferromagnetic materials
* Th bigger the hysteresis, the costlier it is to change polarity.
* -
* -
* -
* For hard materials:
    * Large coercive force.
    * High hysteretic loss.
    * Good for permanent magnets.
    * Applied for permanent magnets and inductive heating 
* For soft materials:
    * Small coercive force
    * Low loss
    * Not for permanent magnets
## 7: Ordered magnetism
* In addition to ferromagnetism, there are other ordered arrangements.
* The atomic magnets can alternate in alignment
    * Antiferromagnetism
* The strengths of the atomic magnets may differ.

## 8: Disordered magnetism
* The second law of thermodynamics tells the nature of disorder.
* In many materials(Paramagnets) the electron spins may be:
    * Far away
    * Weakly interacted
* These magnets are weakly attracted by external field.
* These show no hysteresis.
* Some may repel the field: Diamagnets
## 9: Temperature
* Heating up magnets
    * As the temperature is raised , thermal agitation introduced disorder.
    * Above a critical temperature, it may lost the order and become paramagnetism.
    * For ferro- & ferrimagnets this is called the Curie temperature.
    * And for antiferromagnets the Neel temperature.
* Cooling down metals
    * There is zero electrical resistance
    * This magnet is a perfect diamagnet.
    * These are superconductors.
    * This is fundamentally a quantum magnetic phenomenon, not an electrical one.
    * Superconductors exhibit the Meisner Effect.
