# VII: Buoyancy and Buoyant Force
## 1: Buoyancy
* The phenomenon that keeps a body swim or suspended is known as Buoyancy.
* The force a fluid exerts on a body immersed is known as Buoyant Force($F_B$)
## 2: Buoyant Force
* According to the $2^{nd}$ law of hydrostatic: Pressure in a fluid at rest is constant over any surface normal to the field of a body force.
* The resultant horizontal force has been canceled out, so the buoyant force acts in the vertical direction.
*  The resultant force is the buoyant force acts vertically upward and is equal to the weight of the displaced fluid.
*  Archimedes'law:
$$
F_B=\rho Vg
$$
* This formula can be induced by calculating the resultant force of the both sides of a submerged project.
## 3: Floating body
* For a floating body, its weight is equal to the buoyant force.
* $W=m_{floating body}g$
* $F_B=m_{displaced liquid}g$
* $W=F_B$
* i.e.$m_{floating body}=m_{displaced fluid}$
# VIII: Stability
## 1: Stability
* The buoyant force acts through the centroid of the displaced fluid volume.
* The point B is called the centre of the buoyancy.
* For equilibrium body, there is no moments.
* If the $F$ and $W$ are not in the same line, there will be a rotational moment.
* According to the action of the moment, the types of the equilibrium can be distinguished into 3 parts:
     * Stable
     * Unstable
     * Neutral or neutrally stable
## 2: Submerged Bodies
* For wholly immersed body, the condition for stable equilibrium is that G is under the B.
* If the weight and buoyant force isn not in the same line, then they produce rotational momentum.
   * If G is blow B,the momentum tends to  restore stability.
   * If B is below G then the resultant momentum tends to destabilize the system even more.
   * If the G and B coincide then neutral stability is obtained.
## 3: Stability of the submerged bodies
* When B is above the G, the body is in the equilibrium of the stable.
   * The stable equilibrium case has a righting couple, namely $W\times BG\times \sin\theta$ (anti-clockwise),which si try to restore the tilt(clockwise).
* When B is below G, the body is in unstable equilibrium.
    * The case of unstable equilibrium the couple (anticlockwise) tends to increase the angle of tilt.(anti-clockwise).
* If the B and G are coincident then body is in neutral equilibrium.
## 4: Floating Bodies
* It is not necessary that G is under the B.
* The body undergoes an angular displacement will change the immersed volume so that change the buoyancy (B).
* The new centre of $B$ is $B\prime$ and the new buoyant force is $F_B\prime$.
* We define the metacenter as the point where a vertical through the new centre of buoyancy intersects the continuation of the line BG.
* The distance between the metacenter (M)and centroid (G) is called the metacenter height.
* If the $V$ is he volume of displaced liquid and $\overline{MB}$ is the distance of MB, I is the second order moment of area of the water line:
$$
\overline{MB}=\displaystyle\frac{I }{V}
$$
$$
\overline{MG}=\overline{MB}\pm\overline{GB}=\displaystyle\frac{I}{V}\overline{GB}
$$
* Minus if G is above B and Plus if G is below B.
