# XI: Bernoulli Equation
## 1: The principle of the Bernoulli Equation
* The Bernoulli Equation for general situation
$$
\displaystyle\frac{u^2}{2g}+\displaystyle\frac{p}{\rho g}+z=constant
$$
* In this equation, the $\displaystyle\frac{u^2}{2g}$ part is called the **velocity head**, $\displaystyle\frac{p}{\rho g}$ is called the **pressure head**, while $z$ is called the **potential head**.
* All these heads have the unit of 'm'.
* We can use the **Energy Line** to describe the Energy level of the flow.
* -
* -
* -
* We can also add the loss energy term to get the corrected Bernoulli Equation.
## 2: The pumps and turbines
### 2.1: The Bernoulli Equation for Pumps
* For the pumps can elevate the energy level, the Bernoulli Equations can be rewritten as:
$$
\displaystyle\frac{p_1}{\rho g}+\displaystyle\frac{u_1^2}{2g}+z_1+H_p=\displaystyle\frac{p_2}{\rho g}+\displaystyle\frac{u_2^2}{2g}+z_2+losses
$$
* The $H_p$ is the increased energy per unit weight
* The power pumps transferred to the system can be found by $P=\rho gH_pQ$
### 2.2: The Bernoulli Equation for Turbines
* Turbine can use the system's energy and convert it to power, so the Bernoulli equations can be rewritten as :
$$
\displaystyle\frac{p_1}{\rho g}+\displaystyle\frac{u_1^2}{2g}+z_1-H_t=\displaystyle\frac{p_2}{\rho g}+\displaystyle\frac{u_2^2}{2g}+z_2+losses
$$
* $H_t$ is the energy per unit weight spend on the turbine, which is called the **turbine head**.
* The power systems transferred to the turbine can be found by $P=\rho gH_tQ$, $Q$ stands for the discharge ($m^3/s$)
