# First Day of the Data Bootcamp (focus on the problems)
* Thinking with Data Max Shron - Book Suggested to read 
* Innovation: from the old things 
* Universal principles of innovation: 
    * Everything evolves 
        * Genesis $\rightarrow$ Custom build $\rightarrow$ Products and services $\rightarrow$ Commodity
    * Characteristics changed as things evolved:
        * Example: Video call become commoditised in decades 
    * Commoditisation drives higher order Innovation
    * No single methods fits all 
        * Management principles: agile (action), lean (customer), Six Sigma (control)
        * How to manage: The style of management for innovation at different of the evolution is key tp success.
* Problems vs Solution place:
    * Solution: how, reward to create, fast-pace.
    * Problems: feel no value add.
* Benefit of problem focus:
    * Wider universe of Solution.
    * Deeper understand of the customer.
* Techniques of how to focus on the problems:
    * Asking open-options
      * Root cause analysis
    * 5 Why
* Objects for today: team mates, problem owner, problems
* The Problem:
    * EV
    * Opera Charity
    * Northern Stage 
        * Show 
        * Costumes 
        * Based in Newcastle University
        * Fifty + audiences 
        * No Summer Time 
    * Recycling
Background of the Problem Owners:
* BMS systems years ago
* The Characteristics of new systems
* The Experience of management
* Manual Data Input 
* No detailed data such as the energy compared to the last month
* Only basic parameters 
* Not right temp for stage 1
* stage 3 onn winder should be turn on on hand 
* The need for more intelligent system
* 60 % changed after the pandemic
* Use Teams and dashboard for communication
* Do have a digital communication advisor.
* Most of the cost is electric.
Bootcamp the 3rd Day
* Write the question down 
# Day 4 Data Bootcamp 
## 1: The CRISP - DM Reference Model (extensive process model)
### 1.1: Four levels of abstraction 
* phase: which model, 
* generic task
* specific task 
* process instant 
## 2: Preparing the datasets 
### 1.1: The **providence** of the data 
* Where, how and when 
* Original purpose, the possibility of new data 
### 1.2: Useful format 
* Data Transfer correctly
* Data validation
### 1.3: Transform Data
* Form change (cs)
* Operation application (Maths)
## 3: Gaining knowledge from data 
Raw data $\rightarrow$ Target domain data $\rightarrow$ Pre- processed data $\rightarrow$ Knowledge from data 
## 4: Visualizing the data
* Plot some graphs 
* Specialist Visualization Examples 
* Python library for data Visualization: 
    * Matplotlib, ggplot, Seabom, Plotly 
* Data Visualization : key Insight 
    * Exploratory and Explanatory Analysis: 
        * Exploratory : The journey of hypothesis 
        * Explanatory : The conclusion 
    * Visual Representation: marks and channels 
* The three of understanding:
    * Perceiving  (**show**) $\Rightarrow$ Interpreting (**mean**) $\Rightarrow$ Completing (**mean to me**)
* Data Visualization Skills: 
    * Where and how  (boardroom, live presentation, digital or printed report, etc)
    * type of chart 
    * colour (contrast colour)
    * Gestalt Psychology: perceive visual elements as organized Objects
    * preattentive attributes 
## 5: Intro to Python 
### 5.1: Python packages for Data Science 
* Numpy: 
    * N - Dimensional arrays 
    * Optimized C code 
    * Advanced Indexing
* Pandas:
    * Tabular Data (timelines included)
    * Many formats 
    * cleaning, filtering and merging
    * Visualization
* Matplotlib:
    * Publication quality plots 
    * Interactive figures 
    * Export to a range of formats 
### 5.2: Jupyter
* Coding in web browser 
* Display outputs alongside code 
* Documentation using markdown. 
### 5.3:Reading Documentation
* stackoverflow 
*
